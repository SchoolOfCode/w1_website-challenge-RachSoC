# **My Website Challenge**

## How I started

To be honest, the initial briefing meeting to discuss our requirements was not as structured as you'd hope it would be in the 'real' world. We felt we still had things to learn from the live classes, so we spent our time going through those to make sure we each understood.

For me, this project was more about pair programming. We both felt a little behind, so quickly put in place times to meet and discuss the website challenge and how we would go about it, what we were stuck on, what wasn't making sense and running through things we had learnt on the live clases, such as Github, branching etc.

I really enjoyed working with Umar, we built up a rapport quickly and was able to have honest and frank conversations about any concerns and help address those for each other.

### How I went about building the website.

As well as taking things I have learnt from the live cass and the respository. I googled a lot of different things to try, at times things didn't make sense or a code I had tried may not have worked but I learnt to step away and come back to find that the problem was quite easy once you took focus away from it.

Umar and I shared a notion page where we sent photos and information about ourselves over so that we could use those on our websites.
